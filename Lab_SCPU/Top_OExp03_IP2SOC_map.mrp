      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  35,000    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:     10

      Number with same-slice carry load:        10
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        3,448
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         2,504 out of   3,448   72%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  59 out of   3,448    1%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         885 out of   3,448   25%
    Number of unique control sets:              19
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              69 out of 202,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
