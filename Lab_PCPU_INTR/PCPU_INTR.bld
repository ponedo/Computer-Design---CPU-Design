WARNING:ConstraintSystem:191 - The TNM 'TM_CLK', does not directly or indirectly
   drive any flip-flops, latches and/or RAMS and cannot be actively used by the
   referencing Period constraint 'TS_CLK_100M'. If clock manager blocks are
   directly or indirectly driven, a new TNM constraint will not be derived even
   though the referencing constraint is a PERIOD constraint unless an output of
   the clock manager drives flip-flops, latches or RAMs. This TNM is used in the
   following user PERIOD specification:
   <TIMESPEC TS_CLK_100M 	 	= PERIOD "TM_CLK"       10 ns HIGH 50%;>
   [Codes/Org-Sword.ucf(4)]

WARNING:ConstraintSystem:197 - The following specification is invalid because
   the referenced TNM constraint was removed:
   <TIMESPEC TS_CLK_100M 	 	= PERIOD "TM_CLK"       10 ns HIGH 50%;>
